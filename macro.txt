#define IS_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT
whatever comes after #define - Is this predefined 

Ans)In C and C++ programming, the `#define` directive is used to define a macro, which is essentially a text substitution mechanism. When you use `#define`, you are creating a symbolic name (macro) that gets replaced by the specified value or code wherever it is encountered in the source code.

For example, in your snippet:

#define IS_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT

You are defining a macro named `IS_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT` with no specific value assigned to it. This means that anywhere in your code where you use `IS_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT`, it will be replaced with nothing (an empty string).

For instance, consider this usage:

#ifdef IS_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT
    // Code for horizontal layout
#else
    // Code for other layout
#endif

In this case, if `IS_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT` is defined (either by your `#define` directive or through some other mechanism), the code inside the `#ifdef` block will be included during compilation. If it is not defined, the code inside the `#else` block will be included.

So, to answer your question, the text that comes after `#define` is not predefined in the sense that it doesn't have a built-in or automatic meaning. It's something you, as the programmer, define to suit the needs of your program. It's a way to create constants or enable/disable certain blocks of code based on compile-time conditions.
