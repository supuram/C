/*
typedef int64_t LLONG; 
The code snippet you've provided is a typedef statement in the C or C++ programming language. It defines a new type name `LLONG` as an alias for the existing type `int64_t`. This alias allows you to use `LLONG` instead of `int64_t` when declaring variables, function parameters, or return types.

Here's a breakdown of what this code does:

1. `typedef`: This keyword is used to create a new name (alias) for an existing data type.

2. `int64_t`: This is a fixed-size integer data type provided by the C and C++ standard libraries. It's a 64-bit signed integer type, which means it can hold values ranging from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.

3. `LLONG`: This is the new type name (alias) you're creating using the typedef statement. After this typedef, you can use `LLONG` interchangeably with `int64_t`.

Here's an example of how you might use this typedef in code:
*/

#include <stdint.h>

typedef int64_t LLONG;

int main() {
    LLONG num = 1234567890123LL;  // Notice the use of LL suffix to indicate a long long constant
    printf("Value: %lld\n", num); // Use %lld format specifier to print LLONG
    
    return 0;
}

/*
In this example, `LLONG` is used to declare a variable `num` of type `int64_t`, and the `printf` function uses the `%lld` format specifier to print the value of `num`.

Please note that the typedef itself doesn't create a new data type; it just creates an alias for an existing one to improve code readability and maintainability.
